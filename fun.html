            <h1>Hobby 1: Yoyo</h1>
            <p>I have played with the yoyo on and off for almost 10 years now</p>

            <h2>Hobby 2: Longboarding</h2>
            <p>I occasionally like to take my longboard out for a ride. Someday I would like to invest in an electric longboard.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Family Pet: Bullet the Bull Snake</h3>
            <p>Allow me to introduce "Bullet", otherwise known as "Snake" or "Snaky".</p>
            <p>He (at least I think it's a he, nobody knows for sure) enjoys eating mice and taking the occasional soak in his tub.</p>
            <p>One of the nice things about Bullet is that he requires very little care. All he needs is to be feed and his cage cleaned once a week. 
                In addition, over the winter, Bullet enters a state of semi-hibernation, where he lowers his body temperature and doesn't eat or do anything for more than 3 months.
