                        <b>Purpose:</b>
                        <br>
                        Create a video game based on the Super Mario series which incorporates player interaction, camera movement, and enemy AI behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What I did:</b> 
                        <br>
                        Researched, designed, and tested a videogame using Unity Game engine and C#.
                        <br>
                        I also made it compatible with both Android and WebGL platforms.
                        I plan on expanding this game by bugfixing and adding more levels and features, such as a timer and point system.

                        Create an app that extracts and displays information on how much time the user spends on their phone over various time periods.

                        Researched, designed, and tested an Android app, using Android Studio and Java.
                        This app is still under development and being tested, as there are numerous apps that could be running in the background of a person's phone that tend to offset the statistics.

                        <br>
                        Using Javascript and NodeJS, my team and I created a <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/JediDwag/WebDevProject2">dynamic website</a> that queries information from a US energy database to allow a user to analyze data by year, state, or resource.
                        <br>
                        Our website then uses that information to dynamically generate tables, charts, and images according to the selected year, state, or resource.
