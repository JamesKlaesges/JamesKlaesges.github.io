            <h2>Hobby 1: Yoyo</h2>

              </video>
            <p>I have played with the yoyo on and off for almost 10 years now</p>

            <h2 class = "clearLeft">Hobby 2: Longboarding</h2>
            <img class = "float" width="200" height="300" src = "photos/LongboardZoom.jpg" alt = "Longboard Picture">
            <p>I occasionally like to take my longboard out for a ride. Someday I would like to invest in an electric longboard.</p>

            <h2 class = "clearLeft">Hobby 3: Ping Pong</h2>
            <img class = "float" width="220" height="300" src = "photos/PingPong2.jpg" alt = "Ping Pong Picture">
            <p>I love to play Ping Pong with my two younger borthers. We get very competitive!</p>

            <h2 class = "clearLeft">Our Family Pet: Bullet the Bull Snake</h2>
            <p>Allow me to introduce "Bullet", otherwise known as "Snake" or "Snaky".</p>
            <img class = "float" width="340" height="280" src = "photos/SnakeSnapshot.jpg" alt = "Headshot of the Snake">
            <p>He (at least I think it's a he, nobody knows for sure) enjoys eating mice and taking the occasional soak in his tub.</p>
            <img class = "floatRight" width="220" height="300" src = "photos/SnakeHolding.jpg" alt = "Me holding the Snake">
            <p>One of the nice things about Bullet is that he requires very little care. All he needs is to be feed and cleaned once a week. 
                In addition, over the winter, Bullet enters a state of semi-hibernation, where he lowers his body temperature and doesn't eat or do anything for more than 3 months.
