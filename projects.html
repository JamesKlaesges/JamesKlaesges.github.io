                        <b>Purpose:</b>
                        <br>
                        Create a video game based on the Super Mario series which incorporates player interaction, camera movement, and enemy AI behavior.
                    </p>

                        <b>What I did:</b> 
                        <br>
                        Researched, designed, and tested a videogame using Unity Game engine and C#.
                        <br>
                        I also made it compatible with both Android and WebGL platforms.
                        This game is currently under development, as there are numerous features I would like to add, such as a timer and point system.
                    </p>

                        <br>
                        Create an app that extracts and displays information on how much time the user spends on their phone over various time periods.

                        Researched, designed, and tested an Android app, using Android Studio and Java.
                        This app is still under development and being tested, as there are numerous apps that could be running in the background of a person's phone that would offset the statistics.
